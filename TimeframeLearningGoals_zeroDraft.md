Time frame & learning goals (zero draft)

Leiying PU (Specialization: Technology & Communication)


## Timeline of internship


The proposed time frame in the following picture covers the most of important time spots: starting date and ending date, Internship Preparation Report hand-in time, Internship Reflection Report and Evaluation Form hand-in time, group meeting with university supervisors and host mentors. 


**The starting date:** Depended on the date we sign the Internship Agreement, I could start the internship on the Week March 4 or the week later, Week March 11. Generally, I would prefer to work on Tuesday and Wednesday every week, and thus the starting date would be March 5 or March 13 (sorry for the inconvenience, but I have another appointment on March 12). The date is open for discussion. 


To make sure that we are on the same page, the following I will briefly introduce the **internship procedure** of MCS COM based on the course manual [Master Internship](https://www.utwente.nl/en/com/graduation-web/master/internship/manual.pdf):

1. ✅ Approval from the internship coordinator (Mark Tempelman: m.h.tempelman@utwente.nl)
2. ✅ Assigned to a university supervisor. 
3. ✅ Registration of internship in Mobility Online
4. Being assigned to a mentor of the host organization (host organization)
5. Handing-in Internship Preparation Report within 2 weeks after the starting date (student)
6. Site-visit or Skype meeting between intern, mentor and university supervisor (organized by student)
7. Evaluation the overall internship performance of the student by filling out an evaluation form within 10 days after the end of the internship (by host mentor)
8. Handing-in Internship Reflection Report and Evaluation Form to the university supervisor within 10 days after the end of the internship (student)
9. Final assessment and grade (from the university supervisor)   

**Supervision and assessment:** The main supervision over the internship tasks will of be done by the mentor from the internship host organization. This mentor will provide the internship tasks and guide the student through the related work procedures. Apart from that, the mentor of the host organization is expected to discuss on a regular basis the progress of the student related towards the learning goals. Finally the mentor of the host organization will evaluate the overall internship performance of the student, by filling out an evaluation form. 

## Learning Goals
Before staring the internship, I have proposed the following learning goals based on the SMART principle which requires goals to be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time related:

### Personal learning goals:
1. By communicating (like interviewing, emailing) with at least five users before the end of my internship, I am able to improve my understanding to ‘users’ requirements’. 
1. By completing at least two design (updating) circles before the end of my internship, I want to be able to figure out the feasibility to be a technical consultant  as my future career.
1. By the end of my internship, I want to be able to overcome my procrastination by completing 90 percent of my tasks at least ten minutes earlier than assigned time.

### Academic/subject specific learning goals:
1. By the end of the internship, based on my involvement in designing at least two functional modules in an app/system, I am able to evaluate users’ personas and contribute to successful UX elements in design.
1. By the end of the internship, based on my involvement in at least two complete design processes of a functional module, I am able to acquire sufficient knowledge of the design processes in real design teams. 
1. By the end of the internship, based on my observation of at least three design projects and the relevant knowledge I acquired, I am able to identify in what circumstances Co-design can be applied by proposing a draft checklist. 

According to course manual [Master Internship](https://www.utwente.nl/en/com/graduation-web/master/internship/manual.pdf), we define ‘personal learning goals’ as ‘aspects such as professional or practical skills a student wants to obtain as a result of the internship,' and ‘academic/subject specific learning goals on the other side may be more complicated to formulate or may require more deliberation upfront’.
 
These learning goals will be further elaborated and/or altered during the first two weeks of internship in the first report. The discussion and advice from the university supervisor and the host mentor will also be expected towards those learning goals.
